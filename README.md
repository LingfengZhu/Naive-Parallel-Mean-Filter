# Naive Parallel Mean Filter & Edge detector
This is naive parallel mean filter for image smoothing and edge detector for edge detection implemented in R

## Guideline
- Read the file "mean_filter.html" to understand the main purpose and details of parallel mean filter
- Read the R markdown file "mean_filter.rmd" to execute the source codes
- Read the file "edge_detector.html" to understand the main purpose and details of edge detector
- Read the R markdown file "edge_detector.rmd" to execute the source codes

## Images
There are two images uploaded as examples:
- Van_Gogh.png for mean filter
- Madison.png for edge detection
Feel free to implement using other images
