# Naive Parallel Mean Filter & Edge detection
This is a naive parallel mean filter and edge detector implemented in R

## Guideline
- Read the file "mean_filter.html" to understand the main purpose and details of this project
- Read the R markdown file "mean_filter.rmd" to execute the source codes

## Images
There are two images uploaded as examples:
